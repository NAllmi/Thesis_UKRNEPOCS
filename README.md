## Political Information Fact-Checking Behavior in the Context of the Russia-Ukraine War

### Overview

This research investigates the interplay between media consumption, individual concerns about the Russia-Ukraine war, and fact-checking behavior. The study is conducted using R version 4.2.3.

### Research Questions

**RQ1:** How does the consumption of political information through different media outlets affect the levels of concern in individuals regarding the Russia-Ukraine war?

**RQ2:** How do anxiety and the importance assigned to the Russia-Ukraine war affect the amount of fact-checking performed by individuals?

### Data

The dataset used in this study is not publicly available.

### Code

Before running the models, execute the `master.R` file, which loads libraries and sets the working directory. The `master.R` file runs the following scripts:

- `data_preprocessing.R`: Loads and prepares data. Additionally, this code executes `data_collection_output.R`, generating plots and tables for the data collection section.

- `rq1_models.R`: Runs models for the first research question.

- `rq2_glm_models.R`: Runs models for the second research question.

- `efa.R`: Conducts exploratory factor analysis for the "concern for the war" scale.

### Results

Plots and tables can be found in the `output` folder.
